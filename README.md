Auto Fire Detector
This project is a basic fire detection and alert system using Arduino UNO, a Flame Sensor, a GSM Module, and a buzzer. It is designed to detect fire and send real-time alerts to the user via SMS and calls.

ðŸ”§ Tech Stack
Hardware: Arduino UNO, Flame Sensor, GSM Module, Buzzer

Software: Arduino IDE

Language: C

ðŸ“‹ Features
Detects flame using an IR-based sensor

Sends SMS and makes a call using the GSM module when fire is detected

Activates a buzzer for local audio alert

Real-time monitoring and alert system for enhanced safety

ðŸ“Œ How It Works
The Flame Sensor continuously checks for fire or flame signals.

On detection, the Arduino sends an SMS and initiates a call through the GSM module.

The buzzer is triggered to produce an alert sound.

ðŸŽ¯ Use Cases
Home or office fire safety systems

Industrial fire monitoring

Basic IoT safety projects
